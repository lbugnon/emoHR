% DESCRIPTION
%
% This function is used to initialize, apply and undo normalizations
% on scalar variables. It is the low-level function that upper-level
% functions SOM_NORMALIZE and SOM_DENORMALIZE utilize to actually (un)do
% the normalizations.
%
% Normalizations are typically performed to control the variance of 
% vector components. If some vector components have variance which is
% significantly higher than the variance of other components, those
% components will dominate the map organization. Normalization of 
% the variance of vector components (method 'var') is used to prevent 
% that. In addition to variance normalization, other methods have
% been implemented as well (see list below). 
%
% Usually normalizations convert the variable values so that they no 
% longer make any sense: the values are still ordered, but their range 
% may have changed so radically that interpreting the numbers in the 
% original context is very hard. For this reason all implemented methods
% are (more or less) revertible. The normalizations are monotonic
% and information is saved so that they can be undone. Also, the saved
% information makes it possible to apply the EXACTLY SAME normalization
% to another set of values. The normalization information is determined
% with 'init' operation, while 'do' and 'undo' operations are used to
% apply or revert the normalization. 
%
% The normalization information is saved in a normalization struct, 
% which is returned as the second argument of this function. Note that 
% normalization operations may be stacked. In this case, normalization 
% structs are positioned in a struct array. When applied, the array is 
% gone through from start to end, and when undone, in reverse order.
%
%    method  description
%
%    'var'   Variance normalization. A linear transformation which 
%            scales the values such that their variance=1. This is
%            convenient way to use Mahalanobis distance measure without
%            actually changing the distance calculation procedure.
%
%    'range' Normalization of range of values. A linear transformation
%            which scales the values between [0,1]. 
%
%    'log'   Logarithmic normalization. In many cases the values of
%            a vector component are exponentially distributed. This 
%            normalization is a good way to get more resolution to
%            (the low end of) that vector component. What this 
%            actually does is a non-linear transformation: 
%               x_new = log(x_old - m + 1) 
%            where m=min(x_old) and log is the natural logarithm. 
%            Applying the transformation to a value which is lower 
%            than m-1 will give problems, as the result is then complex.
%            If the minimum for values is known a priori, 
%            it might be a good idea to initialize the normalization with
%              [dummy,sN] = som_norm_variable(minimum,'log','init');
%            and normalize only after this: 
%              x_new = som_norm_variable(x,sN,'do');
%
%    'logistic' or softmax normalization. This normalization ensures
%            that all values in the future, too, are within the range
%            [0,1]. The transformation is more-or-less linear in the 
%            middle range (around mean value), and has a smooth 
%            nonlinearity at both ends which ensures that all values
%            are within the range. The data is first scaled as in 
%            variance normalization: 
%               x_scaled = (x_old - mean(x_old))/std(x_old)
%            and then transformed with the logistic function
%               x_new = 1/(1+exp(-x_scaled))
% 
%    'histD' Discrete histogram equalization. Non-linear. Orders the 
%            values and replaces each value by its ordinal number. 
%            Finally, scales the values such that they are between [0,1].
%            Useful for both discrete and continuous variables, but as 
%            the saved normalization information consists of all 
%            unique values of the initialization data set, it may use
%            considerable amounts of memory. If the variable can get
%            more than a few values (say, 20), it might be better to
%            use 'histC' method below. Another important note is that
%            this method is not exactly revertible if it is applied
%            to values which are not part of the original value set.
%            
%    'histC' Continuous histogram equalization. Actually, a partially
%            linear transformation which tries to do something like 
%            histogram equalization. The value range is divided to 
%            a number of bins such that the number of values in each
%            bin is (almost) the same. The values are transformed 
%            linearly in each bin. For example, values in bin number 3
%            are scaled between [3,4[. Finally, all values are scaled
%            between [0,1]. The number of bins is the square root
%            of the number of unique values in the initialization set,
%            rounded up. The resulting histogram equalization is not
%            as good as the one that 'histD' makes, but the benefit
%            is that it is exactly revertible - even outside the 
%            original value range (although the results may be funny).
%
%    'eval'  With this method, freeform normalization operations can be 
%            specified. The parameter field contains strings to be 
%            evaluated with 'eval' function, with variable name 'x'
%            representing the variable itself. The first string is 
%            the normalization operation, and the second is a 
%            denormalization operation. If the denormalization operation
%            is empty, it is ignored.
% 
% INPUT ARGUMENTS
%
%   x          (vector) The scalar values to which the normalization      
%                       operation is applied.
%                     
%   method              The normalization specification.
%              (string) Identifier for a normalization method: 'var', 
%                       'range', 'log', 'logistic', 'histD' or 'histC'. 
%                       Corresponding default normalization struct is created.
%              (struct) normalization struct 
%              (struct array) of normalization structs, applied to 
%                       x one after the other
%              (cellstr) of length 
%              (cellstr array) first string gives normalization operation, and 
%                       the second gives denormalization operation, with x 
%                       representing the variable, for example: 
%                       {'x+2','x-2}, or {'exp(-x)','-log(x)'} or {'round(x)'}.
%                       Note that in the last case, no denorm operation is 
%                       defined. 
%
%               note: if the method is given as struct(s), it is
%                     applied (done or undone, as specified by operation)
%                     regardless of what the value of '.status' field
%                     is in the struct(s). Only if the status is
%                     'uninit', the undoing operation is halted.
%                     Anyhow, the '.status' fields in the returned 
%                     normalization struct(s) is set to approriate value.
%   
%   operation  (string) The operation to perform: 'init' to initialize
%                       the normalization struct, 'do' to perform the 
%                       normalization, 'undo' to undo the normalization, 
%                       if possible. If operation 'do' is given, but the
%                       normalization struct has not yet been initialized,
%                       it is initialized using the given data (x).
%
% OUTPUT ARGUMENTS
% 
%   x        (vector) Appropriately processed values. 
%
%   sNorm    (struct) Updated normalization struct/struct array. If any,
%                     the '.status' and '.params' fields are updated.
% 
% EXAMPLES
%
%  To initialize and apply a normalization on a set of scalar values: 
%
%    [x_new,sN] = som_norm_variable(x_old,'var','do'); 
%
%  To just initialize, use: 
% 
%    [dummy,sN] = som_norm_variable(x_old,'var','init'); 
% 
%  To undo the normalization(s): 
%
%    x_orig = som_norm_variable(x_new,sN,'undo');
%
%  Typically, normalizations of data structs/sets are handled using
%  functions SOM_NORMALIZE and SOM_DENORMALIZE. However, when only the
%  values of a single variable are of interest, SOM_NORM_VARIABLE may 
%  be useful. For example, assume one wants to apply the normalization
%  done on a component (i) of a data struct (sD) to a new set of values 
%  (x) of that component. With SOM_NORM_VARIABLE this can be done with: 
%
%    x_new = som_norm_variable(x,sD.comp_norm{i},'do'); 
% 
%  Now, as the normalizations in sD.comp_norm{i} have already been 
%  initialized with the original data set (presumably sD.data), 
%  the EXACTLY SAME normalization(s) can be applied to the new values.
%  The same thing can be done with SOM_NORMALIZE function, too: 
%
%    x_new = som_normalize(x,sD.comp_norm{i}); 
%
%  Or, if the new data set were in variable D - a matrix of same
%  dimension as the original data set: 
%
%    D_new = som_normalize(D,sD,i);
