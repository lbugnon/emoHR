%%%%%%%%%%%%% DETAILED DESCRIPTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% som_quality
%
% PURPOSE
%
% Calculates two quality measures for the given map.
%
% SYNTAX
%
%  qe = som_quality(sM,sD);
%  qe = som_quality(sM,D);
%  [qe,te] = som_quality(...);
%
% DESCRIPTION
%
% This function measures the quality of the given map. The measures are
% data-dependent: they measure the map in terms of the given
% data. Typically, the quality of the map is measured in terms of the
% training data. The returned quality measures are average quantization
% error and topographic error.
%
% The issue of SOM quality is a complicated one. Typically two evaluation
% criterias are used: resolution and topology preservation. There are
% many ways to measure them. The ones implemented here were chosen for
% their simplicity.
%
%  qe : Average distance between each data vector and its BMU.
%       Measures map resolution.
%  te : Topographic error, the proportion of all data vectors
%       for which first and second BMUs are not adjacent units.
%       Measures topology preservation.
%
% NOTE: when calculating BMUs of data vectors, the mask of the given 
%       map is used. The mask affects the quantization errors, too.
%       If you want the quantization errors without the weighting given
%       by the mask, you can use the following code: 
%         bmus = som_bmus(sMap,D); % this uses the mask in finding the BMUs
%         for i=1:length(bmus), 
%           dx = sMap.codebook(bmus(i),:)-D(i,:); % m - x
%           dx(isnan(dx)) = 0;                    % remove NaNs 
%           qerr(i) = sqrt(sum(dx.^2));           % euclidian distance
%         end
%         qe = mean(qerr); % average quantization error
%
% Please note that you should _not_ trust the measures blindly. Generally,
% both measures give the best results when the map has overfitted the
% data. This may happen when the number of map units is as large or larger
% than the number of training samples. Beware when you have such a case.
